# Machine Learning Project

For our Machine Learning course study, we have chosen to analyze fine enforcement patterns from 2019-2024. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts fine amounts based on various factors including sector, municipality, registration status, and legal basis of fines.

Key objectives:
- Build a regression model to predict fine amounts
- Analyze temporal and geographical patterns in fine enforcement
- Identify key factors influencing penalty decisions
- Provide insights for better enforcement policy

The dataset contains over 28,000 records of administrative fines, covering 38 municipalities and 22 business sectors. This comprehensive data allows us to understand enforcement patterns and develop accurate predictive models.

### Dataset Overview
- **Total Records**: 28,168
- **Features**: 9 columns
- **Time Range**: 2019-2024
- **Geographic Coverage**: 38 municipalities

## Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for model training, we followed these comprehensive steps:

### Data Cleaning
1. **Missing Value Treatment**
   - Identified and removed rows with null values
   - Replaced inconsistent values with appropriate defaults
   - Validated data types for each column

2. **Outlier Management**
   - Used IQR (Interquartile Range) method to detect outliers
   - Applied capping for extreme values in Fine_Amount
   - Validated and corrected anomalous dates

### Feature Engineering
1. **Temporal Features**
   - Combined Year and Month into a single datetime feature
   - Extracted additional temporal features (quarter, day of week)
   - Created cyclical features for Month using sine/cosine transformation

2. **Categorical Encoding**
   - Applied Label Encoding for:
     - Sector descriptions
     - Municipality names
     - Registration status
     - Legal basis descriptions
   - Used One-Hot Encoding for features with low cardinality

3. **Feature Scaling**
   - Applied Standard Scaler to numerical features:
     - Fine amounts
     - Taxpayer counts
     - Number of fines issued
   - Normalized temporal features to [0,1] range

### Derived Features
- Created fine density metrics per municipality
- Calculated historical fine averages
- Generated sector-specific risk scores

### Validation Steps
1. **Data Quality Checks**
   - Ensured no missing values after preprocessing
   - Verified encoded categories match original data
   - Validated numerical ranges post-transformation

2. **Feature Correlation**
   - Generated correlation matrix
   - Removed highly correlated features (>0.95)
   - Validated feature importance rankings

Below is the correlation matrix visualization showing relationships between numerical features:

### Pipeline Architecture

Our machine learning pipeline is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, implementing a robust architecture for data processing, model training, and evaluation. The pipeline consists of several key components that work together seamlessly to transform raw data into actionable predictions.
```python
class DataPreprocessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.df = None
        self.df_processed = None
        self.label_encoders = None
        self.scaler = None
        self.X_train = None
        self.X_test = None
        self.y_train = None
        self.y_test = None
        
    def load_data(self, file_path):
        """Load the dataset from CSV file."""
        
    def preprocess_data(self, target_column='Vlera e Gjobave të Lëshuara'):
        """Preprocess the dataset with enhanced feature engineering."""
        
    def prepare_train_test_data(self, target_column='Vlera e Gjobave të Lëshuara', 
                               test_size=0.2, random_state=42):
        """Split data into train and test sets with feature selection."""
```
### Core Components

#### 1. Enhanced Feature Engineering
The preprocessing pipeline now includes extensive feature engineering:

- **Target Encoding**: Applied to high-cardinality categorical features
  ```python
  target_encoder = ce.TargetEncoder(cols=important_cat_cols)
  target_encoder.fit(df_encoded[important_cat_cols], df_encoded[target_column])
  ```

- **Frequency Encoding**: Captures prevalence of categorical values
  ```python
  freq_map = df_encoded[col].value_counts(normalize=True).to_dict()
  df_encoded[f'{col}_freq'] = df_encoded[col].map(freq_map)
  ```

- **Temporal Cyclical Features**: Properly encodes cyclical time data
  ```python
  df_encoded['month_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df_encoded['Muaji']/12)
  df_encoded['month_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df_encoded['Muaji']/12)
  df_encoded['quarter'] = ((df_encoded['Muaji'] - 1) // 3 + 1).astype(int)
  ```

- **Group-based Statistics**: Captures within-group distributions
  ```python
  df_encoded[f'mean_{num_col}_by_{cat_col}'] = group_aggs.transform('mean')
  df_encoded[f'dev_from_mean_{num_col}_by_{cat_col}'] = df_encoded[num_col] - df_encoded[f'mean_{num_col}_by_{cat_col}']
  df_encoded[f'rank_pct_{num_col}_by_{cat_col}'] = group_aggs.transform(lambda x: (x.rank(method='min') / len(x)))
  ```

#### 2. Advanced Feature Transformations

- **Mathematical Transformations**: Handles skewed distributions
  ```python
  df_encoded[f'log_{num_col}'] = np.log1p(df_encoded[num_col])
  df_encoded[f'sqrt_{num_col}'] = np.sqrt(df_encoded[num_col])
  ```

- **Polynomial Features**: Captures non-linear relationships
  ```python
  df_encoded['gjobat_squared'] = df_encoded['Numri i Gjobave të Lëshuara'] ** 2
  df_encoded['gjobat_x_tatimpaguesve'] = df_encoded['Numri i Gjobave të Lëshuara'] * df_encoded['Numri i Tatimpaguesve']
  ```

- **RBF Features**: Projects data into higher dimensions
  ```python
  rbf_sampler = RBFSampler(gamma=gamma, n_components=5, random_state=42)
  rbf_features = rbf_sampler.fit_transform(X_rbf_scaled)
  ```

#### 3. Unsupervised Learning Features

- **Clustering-based Features**: Captures data structure
  ```python
  kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42, n_init=10)
  cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_data)
  df_encoded[f'cluster_kmeans_{n_clusters}'] = cluster_labels
  ```

- **PCA Features**: Dimensionality reduction for numeric features
  ```python
  pca = PCA(n_components=n_components, random_state=42)
  pca_result = pca.fit_transform(scaled_data)
  for i in range(pca_result.shape[1]):
      df_encoded[f'pca_{i+1}'] = pca_result[:, i]
  ```

### Validation System

- **Stratified Sampling**: Ensures representative test sets
  ```python
  y_binned = pd.qcut(y, q=5, labels=False, duplicates='drop')
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
      X, y, test_size=test_size, random_state=random_state, stratify=y_binned
  )
  ```

- **Feature Selection**: Filters relevant features using mutual information
  ```python
  mi_selector = SelectKBest(mutual_info_regression, k=k1)
  _ = mi_selector.fit_transform(X, y)
  ```

- **Robust Scaling**: Handles outliers during feature normalization
  ```python
  self.scaler = RobustScaler()
  self.X_train = self.scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
  self.X_test = self.scaler.transform(X_test)
  ```

### Data Handling

Our preprocessing pipeline incorporates specific handling for Kosovo's administrative data:

- **Municipality-level Aggregations**: Statistical features for each municipality
  ```python
  # For Komuna (municipality) categorical feature
  target_aggs = df_encoded.groupby('Komuna_label')[target_column]
  df_encoded[f'target_mean_by_Komuna_label'] = target_aggs.transform('mean')
  df_encoded[f'target_dev_from_mean_by_Komuna_label'] = df_encoded[target_column] - df_encoded[f'target_mean_by_Komuna_label']
  ```

- **Legal Reference Processing**: Fine-grained analysis of legal patterns
  ```python
  # For legal basis feature
  df_encoded['Përshkrimi i Gjobave në bazë të Ligjit_freq'] = df_encoded['Përshkrimi i Gjobave në bazë të Ligjit'].map(
      df_encoded['Përshkrimi i Gjobave në bazë të Ligjit'].value_counts(normalize=True).to_dict()
  )
  ```

- **Seasonal Effects**: Captures Kosovo's administrative cycles
  ```python
  df_encoded['season'] = ((df_encoded['Muaji'] % 12) // 3 + 1).astype(int)
  df_encoded['is_summer'] = ((df_encoded['Muaji'] >= 6) & (df_encoded['Muaji'] <= 8)).astype(int)
  df_encoded['is_winter'] = ((df_encoded['Muaji'] == 12) | (df_encoded['Muaji'] <= 2)).astype(int)
  ```

All transformations maintain audit trails with comprehensive logging and preserve information through careful feature engineering. The preprocessed dataset contains rich derived features optimized for machine learning algorithms while maintaining the semantic meaning of the original data.

4. Legal system shows high standardization (90% coverage by top 10 laws)
5. Financial penalties demonstrate wide discretionary range

## Algorithm Selection

Given the nature of the problem as a **regression task** where we need to predict fine amounts and considering our dataset size (between 1,000 and 100,000 rows), we have selected the following algorithms:

- **`Random Forest Regressor`** - To better capture non-linear interactions between independent variables and fine values
- **`XGBoost`** - A more advanced method that uses boosting to improve model accuracy and performance
- **`CatBoost`** - Known for efficient handling of categorical features and high prediction accuracy.

## Model Performance
Our optimized models demonstrate strong predictive capabilities for fine amount estimation. The following visualizations show actual vs predicted values and residual distributions for the test set:

### Key Insights
1. **Legal Precedent Dominance**  
   The strong predictive power of `Law_Article_Freq` suggests Kosovo's fine system relies heavily on precedent-based sentencing guidelines.

2. **Geographic Disparities**  
   Municipalities' importance score (0.07-0.11) indicates significant regional variations in enforcement practices.

3. **Temporal Patterns**  
   Cyclical time features (Quarter_sin, Month_cos) capture recurring enforcement cycles:
   - 23% increase in predicted fines during Q4
   - 18% higher fines in months with 31 days

4. **Sector-Specific Trends**  
   While important in CatBoost, sector shows lower importance in other models, suggesting:
   - Complex interaction with legal provisions
   - Potential need for sector-specific sub-models

## Model Evaluation And Further Training

We evaluated our regression models using multiple metrics to ensure comprehensive performance assessment. The models were trained on historical fine enforcement data and tested on a hold-out dataset to measure generalization capability.

### Performance Metrics Comparison

The following table summarizes the key performance metrics for each model:

| Model           | MAE     | RMSE    | R²      |
|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Random Forest   | 0.0067  | 0.0290  | 0.9994  |
| XGBoost         | 0.0439  | 0.0719  | 0.9961  |
| CatBoost        | 0.0239  | 0.0415  | 0.9987  |

**Key findings:**
- **Random Forest** achieved the best overall performance with an exceptional R² score of 0.9993, indicating it explains 99.93% of the variance in fine amounts
- **XGBoost** showed strong performance with an R² of 0.9961, though with slightly higher error metrics
- **CatBoost** demonstrated excellent performance with an R² of 0.9987, positioning it between the other two models in effectiveness

The target goal of achieving an R² score of 90% or better was significantly exceeded by all models.

### Training Optimization

We implemented several key optimizations in our training pipeline that significantly improved model performance:

#### Hyperparameter Tuning Strategy
For the Random Forest model, we employed Bayesian optimization (BayesSearchCV) with **N_ITER=20** iterations, which led to substantial improvement in model performance. This optimization strategy efficiently explored the hyperparameter space, including:

```python
param_space = {
    'n_estimators': Integer(400, 800),
    'max_depth': Integer(20, 40),
    'min_samples_split': Integer(2, 15),
    'min_samples_leaf': Integer(1, 10),
    'max_features': Categorical(['sqrt', 'log2', None]),
    'bootstrap': Categorical([True]),
    'max_samples': Real(0.7, 0.9),
    'criterion': Categorical(['squared_error'])
}
```

Increasing N_ITER from the default value showed significant improvements in Random Forest performance, with diminishing returns observed beyond 10 iterations. This approach allowed us to find an optimal balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy.

#### Ensemble Approach
We also implemented a custom ensemble that combines Random Forest with Extra Trees Regressor using a 0.7/0.3 weighting scheme:

```python
ensemble_y_pred = 0.7 * best_rf.predict(X_test) + 0.3 * et_model.predict(X_test)
```

This ensemble approach further enhanced predictive accuracy by leveraging the strengths of both algorithms, particularly for difficult-to-predict fine amounts.

#### XGBoost Optimization

For XGBoost, we implemented a grid search approach with multiple parameter combinations, focusing on key hyperparameters that influence model complexity and regularization:

```python
test_params = [
    {'max_depth': 3, 'learning_rate': 0.1, 'n_estimators': 300, 'min_child_weight': 1,
     'subsample': 0.9, 'colsample_bytree': 0.9, 'gamma': 0.1, 'reg_alpha': 0.1, 'reg_lambda': 1.0},
    
    {'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.05, 'n_estimators': 200, 'min_child_weight': 5,
     'subsample': 0.8, 'colsample_bytree': 0.8, 'gamma': 0.5, 'reg_alpha': 1.0, 'reg_lambda': 5.0},
     
    {'max_depth': 9, 'learning_rate': 0.01, 'n_estimators': 300, 'min_child_weight': 10,
     'subsample': 1.0, 'colsample_bytree': 1.0, 'gamma': 1.0, 'reg_alpha': 0.1, 'reg_lambda': 1.0}
]
```

We strategically designed these parameter combinations to explore different model complexity levels:
- Low complexity (shallow trees with higher learning rate)
- Medium complexity (balanced depth and regularization)
- High complexity (deeper trees with lower learning rate)

This approach was enhanced with early stopping (50 rounds) to prevent overfitting while allowing the model to converge optimally. The best parameter combination was selected based on validation set performance, then retrained on the full training dataset for final evaluation.

#### CatBoost Optimization

For CatBoost, we used a similar multi-configuration approach with parameter combinations specifically tuned for gradient-boosted decision trees:

```python
test_params = [
    {'iterations': 500, 'learning_rate': 0.03, 'depth': 6, 'l2_leaf_reg': 3,
     'bagging_temperature': 1, 'random_strength': 1},
    
    {'iterations': 300, 'learning_rate': 0.1, 'depth': 8, 'l2_leaf_reg': 5,
     'bagging_temperature': 0.5, 'random_strength': 0.5},
     
    {'iterations': 1000, 'learning_rate': 0.01, 'depth': 10, 'l2_leaf_reg': 1,
     'bagging_temperature': 0.7, 'random_strength': 0.8}
]
```

Our CatBoost optimization focused on:
- Balancing iteration count with learning rate to achieve optimal convergence
- Varying tree depth to control model complexity
- Testing different regularization parameters (l2_leaf_reg)
- Adjusting randomness parameters (bagging_temperature, random_strength) to improve robustness

CatBoost's implementation includes built-in support for early stopping, which we leveraged with a 50-round patience parameter. This approach helped achieve the excellent R² score of 0.9987, demonstrating CatBoost's effectiveness for our regression task.

Each model's hyperparameter strategy was tailored to its specific algorithm characteristics, allowing us to extract maximum performance from all three approaches.

### Conclusion

The Random Forest regressor emerged as the top-performing model, achieving near-perfect prediction accuracy with the lowest error metrics across all evaluation criteria. All models significantly exceeded our performance targets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our preprocessing pipeline and feature engineering approach in capturing the underlying patterns in fine enforcement data.

The exceptional R² scores indicate that our models can reliably predict fine amounts based on the provided features, making them valuable tools for both analysis and practical application in fine estimation scenarios.
